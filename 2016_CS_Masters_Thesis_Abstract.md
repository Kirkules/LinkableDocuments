# Thesis: On Barrier Graphs of Sensor Networks
# Author: Kirk A. Boyer
The study of sensor networks begins with a model, which usually has a geometric<br/> 
component. This thesis focuses on networks of sensors modeled as collections of<br/> 
rays in the plane whose use is to detect intruders, and in particular a graph<br/> 
derived from this geometry, called the barrier graph of the network, which captures<br/> 
information about the networkâ€™s coverage. Every such ray-barrier sensor network<br/> 
corresponds to a barrier graph, but not every graph is the barrier graph of some<br/> 
network<br/>.
We show that any barrier graph is not just tripartite, but perfect. We describe how<br/> 
to find networks which have certain designated graphs as their barrier graphs. We<br/> 
show that the size of a minimum vertex cover (in this context called the resilience)<br/> 
of a given graph can yield information about whether and how one can find a sensor<br/> 
network whose barrier graph is the given graph. Finally, we demonstrate that barrier<br/> 
graphs have certain strong structural properties, as a result of the geometry of<br/> 
ray-barrier networks, which represent progress towards a full characterization of<br/> 
barrier graphs<br/>.
