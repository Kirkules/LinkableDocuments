The study of sensor networks begins with a model, which usually has a geometric component. This thesis focuses on networks of sensors modeled as collections of rays in the plane whose use is to detect intruders, and in particular a graph derived from this geometry, called the barrier graph of the network, which captures information about the networkâ€™s coverage. Every such ray-barrier sensor network corresponds to a barrier graph, but not every graph is the barrier graph of some network.
We show that any barrier graph is not just tripartite, but perfect. We describe how to find networks which have certain designated graphs as their barrier graphs. We show that the size of a minimum vertex cover (in this context called the resilience) of a given graph can yield information about whether and how one can find a sensor network whose barrier graph is the given graph. Finally, we demonstrate that barrier graphs have certain strong structural properties, as a result of the geometry of ray-barrier networks, which represent progress towards a full characterization of barrier graphs.
