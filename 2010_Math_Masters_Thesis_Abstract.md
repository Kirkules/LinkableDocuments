# Thesis: Intelligent selection of new data for ranking algorithms\ 
# Author: Kirk A Boyer\ 
Algorithms that rank items using paired comparison data are becoming increasingly \
widely applicable. New data is always being gathered to try to improve their ability\ 
to make predictions. I demonstrate that it is possible to seek data in such a way \ 
that the predictive ability of algorithms will improve without attention to the \ 
particular content of the data, present two methods of doing so, and discuss the \ 
kinds of algorithms to which they are applicable. In addition, I introduce an \ 
alteration to the Colley Matrix [6] rating algorithm that allows it to include \ 
equally-matched comparisons (ties) in a meaningful way.\
