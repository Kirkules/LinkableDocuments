# Thesis: Intelligent selection of new data for ranking algorithms
# Author: Kirk A Boyer
Algorithms that rank items using paired comparison data are becoming increasingly <br/>
widely applicable. New data is always being gathered to try to improve their ability<br/>
to make predictions. I demonstrate that it is possible to seek data in such a way <br/>
that the predictive ability of algorithms will improve without attention to the <br/>
particular content of the data, present two methods of doing so, and discuss the <br/>
kinds of algorithms to which they are applicable. In addition, I introduce an <br/>
alteration to the Colley Matrix [6] rating algorithm that allows it to include <br/>
equally-matched comparisons (ties) in a meaningful way.<br/>
